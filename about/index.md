My name is Sanghyun, and I'm a Web developer using Java and JavaScript. I clearly remember to have started out as a physics major in university, but somehow I find myself weaving words with keyboard   and make them interact with one another to create values out of them. 

I'm not an extensive reader, but I do enjoy reading books and contemplating on them. Borges is my torchlight, Eco my erudite teacher, and Cervantes an undrying fountain of will and humor. 

This will be a knowledge repository for my study on computer science and other micellaneous stuffs in general. It will be of great help if you inform me any misunderstanding or wrong information on anything I write about. 

Thanks.
