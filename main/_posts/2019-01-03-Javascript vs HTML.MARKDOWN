What exactly is the difference between HTML and Javascript? I couldn't answer this question well to myself, and here is what I found. From this posting, I will clarify
1. What HTML is.
2. What JavaScript is.
3. How those two are differernt.

1. What is HTML? (https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
- HTML is an abbreviation for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it describes the structure of webpages using markup languages. Hyper-Text is a term for describing a property of jumping to and from of one webpage to another in the internet. Markup Language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntatically distinguishable from the text; and in HTML people use 'tags'. The internet Browsers such as Chrome and Internet Explorer render these HTML pages to be presented to the viewers.

2. What is JavaScript? (http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs98si/slides/overview.html)
- It is a programming language for the web that can update and change both HTML and CSS. JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data. Its name has nothing to do with another famous programming language Java. (Mocha -> Livescript -> JavaScript). 
- JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. Interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. 


3. How are they different from each other?
- Having written this far, their differences seem obvious. One is a markup lanauge that is used to compose elements of DOM using tags, the other is a programming language that controls elements in DOM and 'doing' some calculations. HTML is static, JavaScript is dynamic. In order to use JavaScript, the tag '<'script'>' is required.
