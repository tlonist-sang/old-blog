### 1. Enumeration

Enum is especially handy when you have to define multiple constants at once. 
It was introduced from JDK 1.5, and is supposedly a better version of enum type in C because it takes care of both value and type.

```java
    static final int CLOVER = 0;
    static final int HEART = 1;
    static final int DIAMOND = 2;
    static final int SPADE = 3;

    static final int ONE = 1;
    static final int TWO = 2;
    static final int THREE = 3;

    final int kind;
    final int number;
```
- Compare the code above with the below

```java
    enum KIND {CLOVER, HEART, DIAMOND, SPADE}
    enum NUMBER {ONE, TWO, THREE}
    final KIND kind;
    final NUMBER number;
```
- Java enum does not only have a specific value, but it also has a type 
- Hence CLOVER is **NOT EQUAL** to ONE.

#### 2. Comparing Enum
```java
    enum DIR {UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT}
    if(dir == DIR.UP) //ok
    if(dir > DIR.RIGHT) //error! cannot directly use ><

    if(dir.compareTo(DIR.LEFT) > 0) //ok
```
- You cannot use >< operators when using enum. Use compareTo instead.

#### 3. Assign values to Enum 
```java
    enum DIR {UP(-1), DOWN(1), RIGHT(11), LEFT(44)}
    private final int value; //why final?
    DIR(int value){
        this.value = value;
    }
```
- When constant values are discontinuous, you can customize the specific values.
- Once you decided to use specific values to enum, you should create instance variable and constructor that can assign values to enum type.

#### 4. Enum and abstract method
```java
    enum USER{
        AMAZON(2){ int totalhealth(int power){return power + BASIC_HEALTH;}},
        WARRIOR(4){ int totalhealth(int power){return power + BASIC_HEALTH;}}, 
        WIZARD(1){ int totalhealth(int power){return power + BASIC_HEALTH;}}, 
        DRUID(2){  int totalhealth(int power){return power + BASIC_HEALTH;}};

        abstract int totalhealth(int power); //abstract method
        private final int BASIC_HEALTH;
        private USER(int health){
            BASIC_HEALTH = health;
        }
    }
```
- When an instance variable belonging to a enum type has to have a calculated value, you can use functions to define them. 
- Most times it's not so much needed. (Why have I spent so much time typing them?)

#### 5. Understanding Enum!

>enum DIR{EAST, WEST, SOUTH, NORTH}

is in fact equal to 

```java
    class DIR{
        static final DIR EAST = new DIR{"EAST"};
        static final DIR WEST = new DIR{"WEST"};
        static final DIR SOUTH = new DIR{"SOUTH"};
        static final DIR NORTH = new DIR{"NORTH"};

        private String name;
        private DIR(String name){
            this.name = name;
        }
    }
```


- Every enum type is a descendent of abstract class Enum; below is a MyEnum class that mocks Enum.
```java
    abstract class MyEnum<T extends MyEnum<T>> implements Comparable<T>{
        static int id = 0; // serial number assigned to enum object
        int ordinal;
        String name = "";

        public int ordinal(){ return ordinal; }
        MyEnum(String name){
            this.name = name;
            ordinal = id++; //value increases whenever object is created
        }

        public int compareTo(T t){
            return ordinal - t.ordinal();
        }
    }
```
- It is noteworthy to think why it is MyEnum<T extends MyEnum<T>> and not just MyEnum<T>
- ?

```Java
    public int compareTo(T t){
        return ordinal - t.ordinal(); // are you sure that t has method ordinal()?
    }
```
- YES. it was set **MyEnum\<T extends MyEnum\<T>>** because in order for compareTo() to work, t.ordinal has to be defined. To be so, T must be descended from MyEnum!
