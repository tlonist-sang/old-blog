# About

Hi, I'm tlonist. I started my career as a web developer who had to do little bit of everything. After lots of struggles I came to realize that having a fundamental understanding in concepts on topics like network, design pattern and language itself is important - and that writing about them is better than just reading. Please feel free to correct or question anything I post here. I'll be happy to communicate. 

I'm a huge fan of an Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, and the name tlonist (mind the absence of umlaut) comes from one of his fictions.

Thanks for reading.
