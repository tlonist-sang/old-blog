There was one time when my company application crashed from the beginning, emitting a bean creation error.
Looking into the source code, I found out that one bean needed for other beans' creation was not created in advance, failing successively in the process of bean creation. For this kind of situation, you need to initialize certain beans after a specific dependent bean is created. A @Lazy annotation can solve this problem.

[https://spring.io/blog/2019/03/14/lazy-initialization-in-spring-boot-2-2](https://spring.io/blog/2019/03/14/lazy-initialization-in-spring-boot-2-2)
>Spring Framework has had support for lazy bean initialization since before its source code moved to Git 11 years ago. By default, when an application context is >being refreshed, every bean in the context is created and its dependencies are injected. By contrast, when a bean definition is configured to be initialized >lazily it will not be created and its dependencies will not be injected until itâ€™s needed.

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class LazytestApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(LazytestApplication.class, args);
    }
}

@Component
public class StartRunner implements ApplicationRunner {
    // @Autowired
    // BeanOne beanOne;

    // @Autowired
    // BeanTwo beanTwo;

    @Override
    public void run(ApplicationArguments args) throws Exception {
        System.out.println("run!");
    }
}

@Component
public class LogBeanPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor {

    @Override
    public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName)
            throws BeansException {
        return bean;
    }
    @Override
    public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName)
            throws BeansException {
        System.out.println((String.format("Bean instantiated with name %s and class %s", beanName, bean.getClass().getSimpleName())));
        return bean;
    }
}
```

BeanPostProcessor is an interface one can use not only for logging, but for various other usages one wants after initialization (as the name obviously suggests).
In the example code following, two classes will be made into spring beans that will be taken care of by the spring context. 

```java

@Component
public class BeanTwo {
    public void twoMessage(){
        //System.out.println("BeanTwo is created!");
    }
}

//@Lazy
@Component
public class BeanOne {
    public void oneMessage(){
        //System.out.println("BeanOne is created!");
    }
}
```

There is nothing special with these beans, just plain classes which has println method within.
When running the code above, below is the result.

```console

```
First of all, beanOne and beanTwo are created because they are @autowired in the applicationRunner class. The order of the beans created, however, may change according to specific settings of your configuration. Anyways, what I want to do here is to specifically making sure that the creation of beanTwo is processed before that of beanOne. 

- To do so, I will put @Lazy annotations for BeanOne classes. What I expect is as following.
1. Springboot scans for the entire packages within the project and creates beans EXCEPT for those that are annotated @Lazy (BeanTwo created)
2. Springboot creates @Lazy beans when it is specifically autowired or being used. (BeanOne created)
Below is the console result.

```console
Bean instantiated with name lazytestApplication and class LazytestApplication$$EnhancerBySpringCGLIB$$ac28e0af
Bean instantiated with name beanTwo and class BeanTwo
Bean instantiated with name beanOne and class BeanOne
```

There are other annotations like @DependsOn, through which you can control the creation of beans specifically with your own taste. 
It will be a topic for future blog posting!
