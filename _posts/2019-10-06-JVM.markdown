##[[JVM (Java Virtual Machine)]]

- All applications made with Java is run on JVM

Normal Application : [ Java Application ] + [OS(windows, linux)] + [Computer(Hardware)]
Java Application   : [ Java Application ] + **[       JVM        ]** + [OS(windows, linux)] + [Computer(Hardware)]

Because Java necessitates JVM,
- write once, run anywhere is possible
- it may be slower than non JVM apps. => JIT compiler 

> #### JDK and JRE(Java Runtime Environment)

> "JDK" contains 
- javac.exe : compiler that compiles Java source code to byte code
- java.exe : interpreter that intereprets and executes byte code produced by the compiler
- javap.exe : reverse assembler that translates class files to java source files

> "JRE" is a subset of JDK 
- it does NOT have Java compiler or libraries like Javadoc and jdb.
- it can be used just to 'run' an already compiled Java application.


> #### How to run a really simple Java Code?

1. Create HelloWorld.java
```java
class HelloWorld{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

2. Compile Java file to class file using Java compiler
3. Run the class file using Java command.
